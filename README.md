### General info

With United Nations Climate Change Conference recently concluded our team got to thinking, wondering what could be a fun way to help reduce the carbon footprint on earth. That is when the idea of our app, FRÆ came up. Planting trees can often be a part of helping reduce the carbon footprint, so we decided to come up with an gameified app, where you and others compete collecting tree seeds and returning boxes, so the seeds can be planted properly and well taken care of.

The apps aim is to compete collecting boxes full of seeds and returning them to get on top of the leaderboard on who offsets most CO2.

### Technologies

- CSS
